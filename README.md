🧮 Python Data Analytics Project – Diwali Sales

A standalone analytics workflow built in Python & Pandas to explore and extract insights from the Diwali Sales dataset.
Performed end-to-end: data loading → preprocessing → exploratory analysis → customer segmentation → insight extraction.

🔥 Key Highlights

* Written & optimized in pure Python (Pandas + Matplotlib)
* Structured data cleaning pipeline
* Statistical EDA on sales performance
* Customer segmentation based on:
   * Gender
   * Age bracket
   * State / Region
   * Occupation
* Visual insights for spend behavior
* Converts raw CSV → interpretable insights
